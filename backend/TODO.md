# TODO (scratchpad)

Durable planning lives in [/docs](../docs/README.md) — roadmap, backlog, eval strategy,
and design decisions. This file is only for in-flight scribbles that die within a
session; anything worth keeping graduates into a `docs/` file.

Migrated 2026-07-17: V1 scoping → `docs/design/node-taxonomy-v1.md` + `docs/roadmap.md`;
code-review/security findings, test gaps, workflow-framework notes → `docs/backlog.md`;
golden-test/suite notes → `docs/eval-strategy.md`. Historical cleanup logs live in git
history (`git log -p -- backend/TODO.md`).

current added intersect and filter retrievals
    * why this way is that at each step
    * i can do a cte to ensure that there are books (candidates)
        * if none or too many then I can ask the user
    * and why seperate the filter is that you can explitcit
    inject human in the loop at that step knowing the previous
    ctes have all the books still. you can constrainst or relax
    the query from the user easier(?)
    * also with intersect, if there are none then
    you know there are no books with that criteria
        * no need to relax of constrainst there
    * same with read books, you can exclude it
    and if there are none then you know they read all
    the books in those criterias like by this or something
    * the problem is you can't go back
        so filter1 -> 
                      intersect
           filter2 ->   
        then you can't change those other filters
        which can be a problem or what you exepect for
        this?
        so maybe for v1 you only want human in the loop
        at the end? for recommend
        if there are none on the other ones, then you 
        can just stop the query?

    * with this split i can do things like
        * my database has 500 sci-fi, I have also 10 books by Jane Austen
        * ui_loading: checking how many books have 200 pages or more
